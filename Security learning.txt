APPLICATION AUDIT RESULTS
This application exhibits the following insecure behavior:

• Inadvertent privilege escalation due to lack of URL protection and general authentication
• Inappropriate or non-existent use of authorization
• Missing database credential security
• Personally-identifiable or sensitive information is easily accessible or unencrypted
• Insecure transport-level protection due to lack of SSL encryption
• Risk level is high

Security Standards in Industry
Two specific security standards that you're likely to run into at some point in your career are the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) and the Health Insurance Privacy and
Accountability Act (HIPAA) privacy rules. Both the standards are
intended to ensure safety of specific sensitive information (credit card
and medical information, respectively) through a combination of
process and software controls. Many other industries and countries have
similar rules around sensitive or Personally Identifiable Information(PII).
 
Failure to follow these standards is not only a bad practice, but
something that could expose you or your company to significant liability
(not to mention bad press) in the event of a security breach

Authentication
Inadvertent privilege escalation due to lack of URL protection and general
authentication.

Authentication is one of the two key security concepts that you must internalize
when developing secure applications (the other being authorization). 
Authentication identifies who is attempting to request a resource.

Authentications type
	Credential-based authentication
	Two-factor authentication
	Hardware authentication
